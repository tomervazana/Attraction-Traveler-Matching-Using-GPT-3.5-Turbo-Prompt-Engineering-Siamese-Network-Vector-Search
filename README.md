SBERT: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
state-of-the-art text and image embedding models. It can be used to compute embeddings using Sentence Transformer models or to calculate similarity scores using Cross-Encoder models
## 3. Vector search based on the summarized features and match between an attraction and a traveler
Vector search using Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
